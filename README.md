## task 1
The bank has n tellers responsible for serving customers. When customers enter the bank, they first take a number and then wait for their number to be called. When a teller is free, the next number is called. Programming is used to solve this problem, and P and V operations are used to synchronize tellers and customers.

## task 2
Perform a quick sort on a data file with 1,000,000 out-of-order data.

## task 3
Using Win32 API functions, write a process that contains two threads, one thread to simulate memory allocation activity, and one thread to track the memory behavior of the first thread.
Operations required to be simulated include reserving a region, committing a region, reclaiming a region, releasing a region, and locking and unlocking a region. The tracking thread should output the memory status after each memory allocation operation.
Through the programming of simulating and tracking memory allocation activities, we can learn from different aspects how Windows manages and allocates virtual memory space for user processes, allocates virtual memory to Windows, changes memory status, and queries physical memory and page file status. Learn more about the functions, parameter restrictions, and usage rules of API functions. Also learn how to write tracking programs.
